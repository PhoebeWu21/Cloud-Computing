Introduction

In this lab you will learn how to deploy and apply the ELK stack for cyber analytics.

Part I 

1)	Establish the ELK stack in AWS:
https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-install-the-elk-stack-on-aws-a-step-by-step

2)	Configure logstash to read AWS logs: 
https://logz.io/blog/install-elk-stack-amazon-aws/

3)	Demonstrate
a.	Logstach Capture of EC2 instance security logs
b.	Kibana Graphics View

Part II

1)	Build a Log Analytic Solution in AWS
a.	Use this file: https://d0.awsstatic.com/Projects/P4113850/aws-projects_build-log-analytics-solution-on-aws.pdf


2)	Demonstrate all completion of all tutorial steps. Be sure to specifically highlight success in 
a.	AWS Elasticsearch
b.	AWS Kinesis Analytics


Part III

1)	Choose an existing cyber data set; reference: http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html. Follow links and contact information to acquire.
2)	Choose atleast one analytic 
a.	From these examples: https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Security%20Analytics
b.	From one of the following frameworks:
i.	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
ii.	https://www.tensorflow.org
iii.	https://scipy.org
iv.	https://ipython.org/notebook.html

Consider the following research and guidance for analytic selection: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs259d/

3)	Select an approach to perform the analytic.  You may use:
a.	The ELK Stack you set up in Part I using any Apache framework
b.	The AWS Elasticsearch and Kinesis system you setup in Part II
c.	The EMR instance you set up in Lab #2.
4)	Describe your solution in a single design diagram, describe the cyber example log ingested and describe the analytic you are using.
5)	Demonstrate:
a.	Cyber Log Ingest
b.	Analytic Execution

Grading Evaluation:
1)	Part 1 (33%)
2)	Part II (33%)
3)	Part III (34%)
